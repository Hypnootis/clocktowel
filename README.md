<h1>Clock Towel</h1>

This is a point and click game developed using Pygame

Currently in early development, you are free to take this source code and modify it to make it into something of your own. If you make something cool with this code, assets or script, feel free to shout me out, but it is not necessary to do so. As this project continues to develop, I hope to eventually release it as a distributable package with an option to donate on a platform such as itch.io or Steam.

The game, called "Clock Towel", is a comedic point and click adventure game developed by Hypnootis, as a personal project and programming excercise to see if I can handle working on an actual polished project. All the code, assets and the story are made by me, using various software.

Development on this game started in 17.1.2021
